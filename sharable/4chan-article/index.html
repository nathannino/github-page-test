 convinced the “ninth circle of Hell” was not doing enough to sabotage 
itself, shady viral marketers posing as 4chan users then <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/24/how-serial-hoaxers-duped-the-internet-with-fake-4chan-threats-against-emma-watson/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4">pretended to hack Emma Watson’s nudes</a> and — in the ensuing Internet-wide cacophony — demanded that 4chan be shut down.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">“The
 recent 4chan celebrity nude leaks have been an invasion of privacy,” 
the hoaxsters railed in an open letter against 4chan, “and [are] also 
clear indication that the Internet NEEDS to be censored.”</p></div><div><p data-el="text">How,
 exactly, does one anonymous Web site generate such outrage? And how can
 a series of wholly anonymous, time-sensitive message boards — message 
boards with an interface straight out of the Geocities age — have such a
 profound, ranging impact on the Internet at large? More importantly: 
Who the heck are these people, and don’t they have anything better to 
do?</p></div><div><p data-el="text">No worries, bewildered reader. We have answers.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">4chan
 is a series of wholly anonymous, anything-goes forums. 4chan, in its 
layout and fundamental operation, is not terrifically different from 
Reddit, Something Awful, or other large-scale Internet forums. The site 
is broken up into threads where users can discuss different topics — 
everything from civet coffee to sex toys&nbsp;— and <a href="http://gawker.com/5925535/4chans-moment-is-over-even-though-its-more-popular-than-ever">something like 22 million users</a> do just that every month.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">A
 couple things make 4chan unusual as a forum, however. For one thing, 
unlike Reddit, users never need to make an account or pick a username — 
even a pseudonymous one. That means participants can say and do 
virtually anything they want with only the most remote&nbsp;threat of 
accountability. It also means you can’t message other users or establish
 any kind of social relationship with them, unless they reveal their 
identity in some way. For a social network, that’s pretty weird. In 
fact, a number of sociologists have spent time studying exactly how it 
works.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">To further complicate things, 
4chan threads expire after a certain amount of time — less time for 
R-rated boards, more time for G or PG ones — which&nbsp;lends a sense of
 impermanence to the whole operation and means that users 
rarely&nbsp;see the exact same thing. Few posts last more than a few 
days before they’re deleted from 4chan’s servers. Posts are organized 
reverse-chronologically — although “organized” maybe overstates it. 
4chan’s interface is deliberately, anachronistically minimalist, which 
can make it difficult for non-regular users&nbsp;to access.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">Bottom
 line: 4chan is a forum — nothing crazy or mysterious there. It’s just a
 forum with no names, few rules and few consequences, which is (a) <a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3665/3055">the philosophical antithesis</a> to virtually every other mainstream social property and (b) means people can (and do!) say just about anything they want.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">According to the <a href="http://www.4chan.org/advertise">site’s own statistics</a>,&nbsp;the
 vast majority of its users are young, college-educated men with an 
interest in Japanese culture, video games, comics and technology. Most 
live in English-speaking countries — the United States, 
Britain,&nbsp;Canada and Australia — but the site also sees sizable 
traffic from Germany, Sweden and France. In&nbsp;late&nbsp;2010, a 4chan
 user&nbsp;conducted a (wholly unscientific) <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/27/4chan/">survey of other site users</a>,
 which found that, among other things, most 4chan users don’t discuss 
the site offline and most users wouldn’t let their kids join it. The 
site’s founder urged readers to take the survey with “a massive grain of
 salt” — since the site thrives on anonymity, he pointed out, there’s 
ultimately no way to know who uses it with any certainty.</p></div><div><p data-qa="article-header"></p><h3>Why is 4chan important/why should I care?</h3><p></p></div><div><p data-el="text">Three
 reasons: First, 4chan is the original incubator for a huge number of 
memes and behaviors that we now consider central to mainstream Internet 
culture. Second, 4chan is responsible for some of the largest hoaxes, 
cyberbullying incidents and Internet pranks of the past five years. 
Third, Anonymous got its start on 4chan — and the hacktivist collective 
is an increasingly important player in news events from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/08/14/how-anonymous-got-it-right-and-wrong-in-ferguson/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21">Ferguson</a>
 to the Steubenville rape. In short, the full list of things 4chan has 
given the Internet would be pretty extensive. But here’s a start on the 
good:</p></div><div><ol><li><span><strong>LOLCats:</strong> funny <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lolcats">pictures of cats with text</a> superimposed on them</span></li><li><span><strong>Dusty the cat:</strong> an abused cat in Oklahoma whose video was posted to YouTube; 4chan tracked down the cat’s owner and sent his details to police.</span></li><li><span><strong>Advice animals:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/advice-animals">pictures of animals or humans</a> with stereotypical or archetypal captions superimposed</span></li><li><span><strong>Rage comics:</strong> a genre of simple, line-drawn Web comics — you probably recognize some of its most familiar characters from memes.</span></li><li><span><strong>Rickrolling:</strong> the practice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">sending someone a link</a> that actually, secretly, links to the music video for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Chocolate Rain:</strong> 4chan users swarmed the music video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwTZ2xpQwpA">Tay Zonday’s “Chocolate Rain,”</a>
 thereby moving it up the YouTube charts and transforming it into a 
veritable meme. Several mainstream artists have since covered it.</span></li></ol></div><div><ol><li><span><strong>Celebgate:</strong> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/02/the-shadowy-world-of-4chan-the-shock-post-site-that-hosted-the-private-jennifer-lawrence-photos/?itid=lk_inline_manual_33">the leak of dozens</a>
 of stolen celebrity nude photos, which — while no longer available on 
4chan — still exist as downloadable torrents across the Web.</span></li><li><span><strong>Gamergate:</strong> an ongoing movement to expose “corruption” in video game journalism, which was (purportedly!) <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/09/new-chat-logs-show-how-4chan-users-pushed-gamergate-into-the-national-spotlight/">drummed up by 4chan</a>
 users. Gamergate has since wrecked the lives of several female gamers 
and commentators and spawned a larger discussion about the way that 
industry treats women.</span></li><li><span><strong>The cyberbullying of Jessi Slaughter:</strong> one of the earliest <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/jessi-slaughter">high-profile incidents of cyberbullying</a>, in which 4chan members sent death threats and calls to an 11-year-old girl who would later make multiple suicide attempts.</span></li><li><span><strong>Google- and poll-bombing:</strong>
 voting or searching for the same terms en masse, to either sabotage an 
online vote or make a topic trend artificially. 4chan has successfully 
gotten a swastika to trend on Google.</span></li><li><span><strong>Fake bomb threats:</strong> a vast number of hoaxers have posted mass bomb and shooting threats to 4chan, prompting several arrests and evacuations.</span></li><li><span><strong>#Cutforbieber:</strong> a Twitter hashtag that encouraged <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/4chan-cut-for-bieber-hashtag-trend-hoax/">young Beliebers to cut themselves</a> to demonstrate their love for the performer.</span></li><li><span><strong>#Leakforjlaw:</strong> a similar <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/leakforjlaw-4chan-users-stand-in-solidarity-with-jennifer-lawrence-after-nude-pictures-leak-9704379.html">social media prank</a> that encouraged women to post their nude photos in support of Jennifer Lawrence.</span></li><li><span><strong>Bikini bridge:</strong> an invented <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/01/08/the-bikini-bridge-4chans-latest-prank-is-actually-pretty-dangerous/?itid=lk_inline_manual_40">beauty/fitness trend</a>
 that encouraged women to lose enough weight to create a gap between the
 bones of their hip and pelvis; the trend, though fake, eventually 
caught on in online eating-disorder communities.</span></li><li><span><strong>Apple Wave:</strong>
 an alleged “feature” of the iPhone 6, hyped by 4chan users on Twitter, 
wherein people can charge their phones by microwaving them. Needless to 
say, that’s one of many 4chan news hoaxes.</span></li><li><span><strong>Ebola-chan:</strong> a jokey cartoon “mascot” for Ebola that, in the hands of some particularly unprincipled 4chan users, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/09/22/4chans-latest-terrible-prank-convincing-west-africans-that-ebola-doctors-actually-worship-the-disease/?itid=lk_inline_manual_42">became a hoax</a> directed at vulnerable West Africans.</span></li></ol></div><div><p data-qa="article-header"></p><h3>Doesn’t 4chan have any rules?</h3><p></p></div><div><p data-el="text">There are <a href="http://www.4chan.org/rules">a few rules</a>.
 Users are banned from violating U.S. law, including copyright law, and 
from posting other people’s personal information, impersonating site 
administrators, and using bots on the site. Users can post racist, 
graphic and other “grotesque” material, but only on the board /b/. (More
 on that later.) 4chan has teams of referees it calls “moderators” and 
“janitors,” who can delete posts and ban users who post illegal content.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">But
 4chan is notoriously tight-lipped about who moderates it — and how 
much. 4chan appears to see that secrecy as part of its ethos. “There is 
no way for an end user to accurately judge the amount of moderation 
taking place at any given point in time,” the site <a href="http://www.4chan.org/faq">explains in an FAQ</a>.</p></div><div><p data-qa="article-header"></p><h3>Is 4chan inherently evil?</h3><p></p></div><div><p data-el="text">That
 doesn’t mean 4chan is inherently evil, or that everything on the site 
is somehow depraved. Just like Reddit or Hacker News or anything else, 
the good and the bad coexist. You get message boards like /b/, which 
frequently traffic in gore and other shock porn. But you also get people
 talking about how to roast raw coffee beans or come out as gay to their
 families.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">4chan’s board topics include 
cooking, fitness, fashion, technology, music, and math; they also 
include several boards dedicated to weapons, “politically incorrect” 
discussion, and hardcore — often disturbing — porn. Huge swaths of the 
site are dedicated to anime, manga and other Japanese cultural outputs, a
 legacy of the site’s creation in 2003. When 4chan’s founder, 
Christopher (“moot”) Poole, created the site in October of that year, he
 drew largely on the community in one of Something Awful’s anime forums.
 Poole, 15 at the time, is now in his mid-20s.</p></div><div><p data-qa="article-header"></p><h3>So whenever we talk about hoaxes and leaks and other icky 4chan stuff, where does that come from?</h3><p></p></div><div><p data-el="text">4chan,
 as of this writing, has 63 “boards,” or subforums. Two of those — /b/ 
and /pol/ — are primarily responsible for 4chan’s less-than-stellar 
reputation.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">/pol/, or “politically 
incorrect,” ostensibly exists to discuss news and politics — but those 
discussions frequently dissolve into racial or misogynistic slurs. Of 
course, that’s not so different from, say, The Washington Post comments 
section. But while The Washington Post employs people to make sure the 
n-word and other nastiness don’t get around, /pol/ hurls them around 
frequently. This is where we saw the birth of the “Ebola-chan” meme.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">As
 gross as /pol/ can get, however, /b/ is another animal entirely. The 
board serves as a kind of catch-all/release valve for all the rape porn,
 self-harm pics, and creepy drawings of scantily clad children that 
aren’t allowed in other forums. That’s by design, too: 4chan technically
 bans trolling, racism and grotesque imagery elsewhere on the site, but 
permits it in /b/. Even /b/ isn’t totally awful — a thread posted just 
this morning debates good Netflix recs — but it’s still an unfathomable 
grab-bag of the random, the gross and the downright bizarre.</p></div><div><p data-qa="article-header"></p><h3>How do 4chan in-jokes morph into major Internet trends?</h3><p></p></div><div><p data-el="text">In
 a phrase, what happens on 4chan does not stay on 4chan — not when it 
gets big, anyway. In-jokes and other benign ephemera tend to filter out 
organically, via users’ other online networks and social media accounts.
 (Celebgate, as I wrote earlier this month, reached the mainstream <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/09/05/meet-the-unashamed-33-year-old-who-brought-the-stolen-celebrity-nudes-to-the-masses/?itid=lk_inline_manual_60">via a joint Reddit/4chan user</a> named John Meneses.)</p></div><div><p data-el="text">But
 frequently, 4chan is a bit more proactive in pushing its creations on 
the masses. When users orchestrate major hoaxes or pranks, for instance,
 they’ll often create fake Twitter accounts and hashtags to popularize 
the story or attract media attention. They’re also quite adept at gaming
 any platform that surfaces content based on popularity: that includes 
not only Twitter, which highlights “trending” topics, but also YouTube 
and Google Trends. Because certain forums have been so successful at 
getting a group of people to take action at once, 4chan’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/09/AR2010080906102.html?hpid=topnews&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_63">been credited</a> for pulling off “some of the highest-profile collective actions in the history of the Internet.”</p></div><div><p data-qa="article-header"></p><h3>But … why would anybody do that?</h3><p></p></div><div><p data-el="text">Honestly,
 it’s very difficult to guess 4chan’s motives, particularly since no one
 knows exactly who uses the site, and in exactly what numbers. But 
generally speaking, based on many hours spent hanging around the site, 
the people that spread hoaxes are often in it for the lulz — the 
schadenfreude, in other words. The visceral joy of laughing at someone 
else’s stupidity/expense. Even a decade after its launch, it’s pretty 
obvious that 4chan was founded by a teenage boy — and also obvious, I 
suspect, that many of its users still fall in that demographic, despite 
4chan’s insistence that minors aren’t allowed on&nbsp;the site. (It’s 
telling that, when you enter “4chan users” into Google, one of the first
 suggested searches is “…are losers.”)</p></div><div><p data-el="text">But
 there are plenty of other reasons to use 4chan too, of course. For 
other people, 4chan’s radical anonymity also functions as something of a
 safe space, a place to discuss interests or curiosities that would be 
taboo anywhere else. (It’s no coincidence that the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/04/23/dont-laugh-but-bronies-may-be-propping-up-one-of-americas-favorite-companies/?itid=lk_inline_manual_68">brony subculture</a>
 has its very own 4chan board.) The frequency of offensive language and 
slurs — used so casually, even unmaliciously — would seem to suggest 
users just crave a place to shake off any and all social rules. In fact,
 Poole said as much in <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/one-on-one-christopher-poole-founder-of-4chan/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">an interview with the New York Times</a> in 2010:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>I
 get a lot of e-mail messages from people who say thanks for giving them
 a place to vent, an outlet to say what they can’t say in real life with
 friends and work colleagues — things that they know are wrong, but they
 still want to say.</p></blockquote></div><div><p data-el="text">That 
said, there’s no doubt that a lot of legitimately racist, mysoginistic, 
homophobic, pedophilic and otherwise unsavory people flock to 4chan, 
too. And those shady characters, mixed in with the pranksters and the 
radical-anonymity advocates, make for a volatile mixture: a place where 
any kind of mischief is wholly possible.</p></div><div><p data-qa="article-header"></p><h3>So we should shut 4chan down, right?</h3><p></p></div><div><p data-el="text">Wrong. Outside of <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/09/rantic-marketing-4chan-emma-watson-leak-hoax.html">“Rantic Marketing”</a>
 — the serial hoaxers/annoying Internet humans that generated the 
Emma-Watson-nudes faux-scandal this week — very few people want to see 
4chan go offline. The site’s founder, Poole, has argued convincingly 
that there’s inherent value in having, and shedding, multiple identities
 online. And 4chan is really a hotbed of creativity and dialogue, even 
if much of that creativity and dialogue is stuff you’d maybe rather not 
see.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">That said, 4chan’s moderation — 
much like Reddit’s — leaves something to be desired, particularly 
because it’s so very, blackly opaque. For all we know, Poole himself is 
the only wizard behind the curtain.</p></div><div><p data-el="text">But 
maybe that metaphor isn’t apt; it would seem to imply, after all, that 
somebody’s running the 4chan show. And when all is said and done, 
4chan’s boundless, faceless anarchy is its defining characteristic — and
 the reason it’s become a kind of Internet bogeyman, equally hated and 
unknown.</p></div></section></div></div></div>
